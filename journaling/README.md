### Overview
This prompt is designed to create an intelligent, helpful assistant that interacts with users across any topic while keeping a detailed interaction journal. The journal allows users to return and continue from where they left off by submitting the summarized section of previous requests. The assistant is built to ensure that each interaction is logged in a structured format, making it easy to track and review past discussions.

### Features

1. **RESPONSE Formatting**: The assistant formats its responses according to the user's request, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
  
2. **JOURNALING**: Each interaction is meticulously recorded in a codebox using markdown format. The journal captures the essence of the user's request, ensuring no detail is lost. Each request is given a unique identifier and a brief description, with the format being hierarchicalâ€”each new interaction includes all previous ones.

3. **ONE SHOT Summary**: The assistant compiles all individual requests into a single, unified request. This summary is presented in a markdown code block, offering a high-level overview of the user's objectives without losing any details.

4. **TAXONOMY Creation**: The assistant categorizes the content into a breadcrumb-style Knowledge Tree, tagging content for easy retrieval. This taxonomy is also presented in a codebox using markdown format, making it simple for users to navigate past interactions.

5. **Style and Consistency**: The assistant ensures all responses are clear, consistent, and formatted for easy reference, particularly for technical or support-related inquiries. It utilizes markdown and clear identifiers to effectively organize and review requests.

### Usage
